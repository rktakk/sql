**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my past and current experiences, I believe there are a number of initiatives that can be implemented to include ethics and inequity components. 

The first would be to develop guidelines and provide training. Both the guideline and training should be accessible for all individuals within an organization. This would allow individuals working with the data directly to implement best practises when handling the data. 

his would also allow for transparency throughout the data lifecycle. For those not working directly with the data, it would allow them to ask better questions and make more informed decisions or seek out additional information. 

It would also be beneficial to hire individuals from diverse backgrounds with varying skill sets (whenever possible). This would allow for the elimination of some biasâ€™s and help avoid an echo chamber situation.
